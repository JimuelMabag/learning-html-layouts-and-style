<a href=" https://www.softcover.io/read/6070fb03/moby-dick"> <h4><p><i>Moby-Dick<i></p></a> by Herman Melville Begins with these immortal words</h4>
<h5>Call me Ishmael. Some years ago-never mind how long precisely-having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a littele and see the watery part of the word. It is a way I have of driving off the pleen and regulating the circulation</h5>
<h6>After driving off his spleen (which can't be good for you), Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approximatelyone jillion pages. The only thing bigger then Moby Dick (who-spoiler aler!- is a giant white) is the book itself.</h6>
